\title{Permutation test to evauluate if gene-metabolite associations pairs
are significantly closer than randomly selected gene-metabolite pairs}
\usage{
permutationTest(pathwayId, data, geneMeasured, metaboliteMeasured, permutation,
  output = c("medians", "pvalue", "histogram"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data, }{data.frame() colunm c(gene, metabolite) representing association
between them for each row geneMeasured, list of evaluated genes in study
(associated and not associated) metaboliteMeasured, list of measured
metabolites in study (associated and not associated)
permutation, number of permutation to execute
output, "medians" median value of permutated sets - "pvalue" - "histogram"}
}
\description{
Permutation test to evauluate if gene-metabolite associations pairs
are significantly closer than randomly selected gene-metabolite pairs
}
\examples{
permutationFunction("hsa01100", data, gene, metabolite, 1000)
take out chosen gene (and his number of reactions)
from list of possible genes
create new 'data' where associated genes and metabolites
are replace by shuffle genes and metabolites for genes
get id of known distance rows in permutation set to
to delete from distance calculation process
get rows to update count
