\title{Function that output a heatmap to visualize distance calculated between every
gene-metabolite associations in input.}
\usage{
heatmapAsso(pathwayId, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwayId}{KEGG Id of selected map}

\item{data}{is a dataFrame with 2 columns. Where each line
reprensents an associations with the first column as
gene KEGG Ids and the sencond column as metabolite
KEGG Ids.}
}
\description{
Function calculting shortest distance between every genes and metabolites in
a gene-metabolite pairs of your data parameter on a graph model of KEGG map
selected, where nodes are metabolites and reactions are edges.
}
\details{
If a gene or a metabolite is present on multiple edges or nodes, then
shortest distance are calculated for every combinaison possible and the
shortest distance is selected.

Output : Heatmap graphic where black countoured distances represent
          an association.
