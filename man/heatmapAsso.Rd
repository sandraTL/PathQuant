\title{Function that output a heatmap to visualize distance calculated between every
gene-metabolite associations in input.}
\usage{
heatmapAsso(pathwayId, association)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwayId}{KEGG Id of selected pathway.}

\item{association}{Dataframe with 2 columns, where each line reprensents an
association. First column are genes and the sencond column are
metabolites. Only use KEGG Ids.}
}
\description{
Function calculting shortest distance between every genes and metabolites in
a gene-metabolite pairs of your association parameter on a graph model of KEGG map
selected, where nodes are metabolites and reactions are edges.
}
\details{
If a gene or a metabolite is present on multiple edges or nodes, then the shortest distance is selected.

Output : Heatmap of distances calculated between associated genes-metabolites.
Columns represent genes and rows represent metabolites. The calculated distance is shown in each cell with the corresponding color code (from red - closest; to yellow - farthest).
