##Description  

PathQuant aims to quantify associations between gene-metabolite association.
To do so, PathQuant calculates distance in terms of reactions 
between Genes and Metabolites mapped on KEGG's metabolic pathway maps. We 
developped functions to give the user tools to calculate dsitance for 
associatiosn data, but also to be able to compare the distance of associated
gene/metabolite pairs to not associated pairs in a statistical manner.

## Info 

The example data used is from the Shin & al Study [1]. 'associatedGeneMetaDF'
is a subset of gene-metabolite associations reported in this study whereas 'completeMetaboliteDF' is all the measured metabolite of this study.

## Fonctions

```{r}
library("PathQuant")
```
###getDistanceAsso Function 
This function enables the user to select a KEGG map on wich the associated data 
will be mapped to calculate the shortest distance between each associations.The 
output of the function is an exhaustive dataframe as it has the following 
columns : geneKEGGId, geneCommonName, isGeneOnMap, metaboliteKEGGId, 
metaboliteCommonName, isMetaboliteOnMap, distance). If a distance is Inf,it 
means both gene and metabolite are on the map but no path exist between them.
If a distance is NaN, it means either the gene or the metabolite or both aren't 
on the map.

####Arguments : 
    pathwayId: is the KEGG Id of the selected map
    associatedGeneMetaDF : is a dataFrame with 2 columns. Where each line 
                            reprensents an associations with the first column as
                            gene KEGG Ids and the sencond column as metabolite
                            KEGG Ids.
  Options :
    ordered : boolean, orders the dataframe by distance columns (ascendent).

```{r, size=12}

df <- getDistanceAsso(metabolismOverviewMapKEGGId, shinAndAlDF, F)
df[1:10,]

```

###getDistanceAll Function 
This function calculates the shortest distance between every gene in 
an association to all measured metabolites on a selected map. The output of this
function is a dataframe of all calculated distance. If a distance is Inf, it 
means both gene and metabolite are on the selected map but no path exist between
them and if the distance is NaN, it means either the gene or metabolite or both 
aren't on the selected map. The aim of this function is to be used for statiscal
analysis of the results. In most cases, it is necessary to compare the distance 
of associated data vs not associated data. 

####Arguments : 
    pathwayId: is the KEGG Id of the selected map
    associatedGeneMetaDF : is a dataFrame with 2 columns. Where each line 
                            reprensents an associations with the first column as
                            gene KEGG Ids and the sencond column as metabolite
                            KEGG Ids.
    completeMetaboliteDF : is a dataframe of 1 column with the KEGG Ids of
                           all measured metabolites.


```{r, size=12}
df1 <- getDistanceAll(metabolismOverviewMapKEGGId, shinAndAlDF, completeMetaboDF)
df1[1:5,]
```


###distributionGene Function
This function calculates the distance between 1 gene and
all metabolites measured. The output is a barplot showing the distribution of 
the distance calulated. The plot is depicted as frequency bars, which represent the number of metabolites at a given distance for the selected gene. Frequency bars are shown in grey for metabolites that are not associated with the selected gene and in red if there is at least one metabolite associated with this gene.

####Arguments : 
    pathwayId: is the KEGG Id of the selected map
    associatedGeneMetaDF : is a dataFrame with 2 columns. Where each line 
                            reprensents an associations with the first column as
                            gene KEGG Ids and the sencond column as metabolite
                            KEGG Ids.
    completeMetaboliteDF : is a dataframe of 1 column with the KEGG Ids of
                           all measured metabolites.
    gene : KEGG ID of the selected gene used to calculates all distances from.

```{r, fig.width=7,fig.height=4}
distanceGeneToAllMetabolite(metabolismOverviewMapKEGGId, shinAndAlDF, completeMetaboDF, "hsa:1373")
distanceGeneToAllMetabolite(metabolismOverviewMapKEGGId, shinAndAlDF, completeMetaboDF, "hsa:27165")

###heatmapAsso Function 
This function calculates the distance between every gene in a associations 
to every metabolites in an associations. Thus, the purpose of the function is to
provide a rapid insight of the difference of the distance between associated or 
not gene/metabolite pairs. If a distance is Inf, it means both gene and metabolite 
are on the selected map but no path exist between them.

####Arguments : 
    pathwayId: is the KEGG Id of the selected map
    associatedGeneMetaDF : is a dataFrame with 2 columns. Where each line 
                            reprensents an associations with the first column as
                            gene KEGG Ids and the sencond column as metabolite
                            KEGG Ids.

```{r, fig.width=7,fig.height=4}
heatmapAsso(metabolismOverviewMapKEGGId, shinAndAlDF)
```
