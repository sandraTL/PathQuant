## **Description**  

PathQuant aims to systematically and quantitatively annotate gene-metabolite
pairs throught metabolic pathway mapping using the KEGG  to reveal biological insight.

To do so, PathQuant computes shortest reactional distance (srd), which is
define as the number of reaction separating a gene (represented as the edge of the pathway) and a metabolite (represented as the node of the pathway).

We developped a tool to able the computation of srd for gene-metabolite pairs.
     
### **Info** 

The example data used is from the Shin & al Study [1]. 
The 'shinAndAlDF' is the gene-metabolite associations reported in this study and 'completeMetaboliteDF' are all the measured metabolite of this study.

### **Fonctions**

##### **get.srd Function** 

###### **Description**
This function enables the user to input their list of gene-metabolite pairs and compute srd values using all metabolic pathways of KEGG by default or using a selected list of metabolic pathways in KEGG. Srd values are computed when both the gene and the metabolite of a given pair is mapped within a same metabolic pathway. 

The output of the function is a dataframe with annotation of gene product, 
metabolite class, enzyme EC number, the computed srd as well as the reacional path used for srd copmutation. Note that an infinite distance (Inf) means that both gene and metabolite of a given pair are on the same map but no path exist between them.
If a srd has a Not Computed value, it means neither the gene or the metabolite (or both) are on any of the selected pathway.


###### **Arguments** 
<ol>
    pairs         Dataframe with 2 columns, each line reprensent a unique                       pair. First column are genes and the
                  sencond column are metabolites. Only use KEGG Ids.
    pathway       List of selected pathway(s). Default = All. Only use KEGG Id(s). 
    organism      Id of KEGG organism (ex: hsa)  
    
    Options :
    ordered       Boolean, orders the dataframe by srd columns (ascendent). Default = "False".
    commonNames   Boolean, to retrieve gene and metabolite common names. Default = "False".
    path          Boolean, to retrieve the reactional path used for srd computation. Default = "False". 
</ol>

```{r, size=12, eval=FALSE}
df <- get.srd(shinAndAlDF, "All", F, F, F)
df[1:10,]

```

###### **distribution.gene**

Function computing srd between a selected gene and a specific list of metabolites within a given metabolic pathway. The plot is depicted as frequency bars, which represent the number of metabolites at a given srd of the selected gene. Frequency bars are shown in grey for metabolites that are not associated with the selected gene and in red if there is at least one metabolite associated with this gene.


###### **Arguments** : 
    pathway : Selected pathway. Only use KEGG Id.
    gene : Selected gene used to compute srd from. Only use KEGG Id.
    pairs : Dataframe with 2 columns, where each line reprensents a unique
           pair. First column are genes and the sencond column are metabolites.            Only use KEGG Ids.
    metabolites   Dataframe of 1 column containing specific metabolite(s). Default "All" is all metabolites in the selected pathway. 
                  Only use KEGG Ids.
    

```{r, fig.width=7,fig.height=4, eval=FALSE}
distribution.gene("hsa01100", "hsa:1373", shinAndAlDF, completeMetaboDF)
distribution.gene("hsa01100", "hsa:27165", shinAndAlDF, completeMetaboDF)

##### **heatmap**

Function that output a heatmap to visualize srd computed between every gene-metabolite pairs in input.
Heatmap of srd computed between every gene and metabolite in pairs mapped on the genome-scale metabolism reconstruction of KEGG. Columns represent genes and rows represent metabolites. The calculated distance is shown in each cell with the corresponding color code (from red - closest; to yellow - farthest). Th srd computed for the  
gene-metabolite associations are reported in cells with a thick black border. 
Inf = infinite value, which mean that there is no known path between gene 
and metabolite.

##### **Arguments** 
    pathwayId      KEGG Id of selected pathway.
    association    A dataFrame with 2 columns. Each line 
                   reprensents an associations with the first column as
                   gene KEGG Ids and the sencond column as metabolite
                   KEGG Ids.

```{r, fig.width=7,fig.height=4, eval=FALSE}
