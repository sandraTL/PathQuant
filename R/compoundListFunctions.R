# This function creates a data frame which contains the duplicated compounds
# in the initial graph. We need this because some reaction has a subtrate or
# a product that has a metabolite that we find more than one in the graph but
# we don't know which node we should use (reaction type ortholog). We prefere
# not to use those reactions
